Not officially released (but finished) Minecraft plugin made for the non-existing MCTraps.eu server. This plugin is an ticket system with assigning to moderators, with integration with database â€” so you can access the tickets from the website. In plans there was an mobile application to manage the tickets. Some day I will rewrite everything and release officially.
